                <![CDATA[ Brave's browser can automatically bypass Google's AMP pages ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Brave is putting Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-17-googles-fast-loading-aagoogle-amp-shows-original-domainsmp-tech-wont-hide-original-web-links.html">Accelerate Mobile Pages</a> (AMP) on blast with a new feature called De-AMP, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032776/brave-de-amp-google-browser"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported. It&#39;s designed to bypass any pages rendered with AMP and take users directly to the original website. &quot;Where possible, De-AMP will rewrite links and URLs to prevent users from visiting AMP pages altogether,” the company <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><p>If that&#39;s not possible, then &quot;Brave will watch as pages are being fetched and redirect users away from AMP pages before the page is even rendered, preventing AMP/Google code from being loaded and executed,&quot; it added.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new feature was implemented in the name of privacy, security and internet experience, according to Brave. &quot;In practice, AMP is harmful to users and to the Web at large,&quot; the article states. &quot;Just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the web.&quot; It adds that the next iteration of AMP &quot;will be even worse.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Google originally promoted AMP as a way to improve the mobile web experience by loading pages faster. However, it has recently been a target of critics who see it as a way for Google to increase its hegemony in the internet ad market by hosting content on its own servers. A group of publishers recently announced it was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/publishers-move-to-abandon-google-supported-mobile-web-initiative-11645725640">moving away</a> from AMP, and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-misled-publishers-and-advertisers-unredacted-lawsuit-alleges-11642176036?mod=article_inline">lawsuit</a> filed by several US states accuses Google of running a monopoly that harmed ad-industry competitors and publishers.</p><p>Brave promises &quot;the best privacy online&quot; with its browser, so of course attacking Google is part of its business strategy. Despite its efforts, though, it lags well behind most other browsers in mobile market share, sitting in the &quot;other&quot; category behind Internet Explorer on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/worldwide">Statcounter</a>. De-AMP is now available in beta and &quot;will be enabled by default in the upcoming 1.38 Desktop and Android versions, and will be released on iOS soon after,&quot; Brave said.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ Delta confirms it worked with SpaceX to trial Starlink's satellite internet ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian has revealed in an interview that the airline held talks with SpaceX and conducted &quot;exploratory tests&quot; of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-price-increase-elon-musk-224036155.html">Starlink&#39;s</a> internet technology for its planes. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-air-lines-tested-spacexs-starlink-internet-for-planes-delta-ceo-says-11650316287?mod=tech_lead_pos3"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Bastian declined to divulge specifics about the test, but SpaceX exec Jonathan Hofeller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526601/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-internet-talks-commercial-airlines-in-flight-wifi">talked about</a> the company&#39;s discussion with several airlines back in mid-2021. Hofeller said back then that the company was developing a product for aviation and that it&#39;s already done some demonstrations for interested parties.&nbsp;</p><p>SpaceX chief Elon Musk tweeted in the same period last year that Starlink antennae for planes would have to be certified for each aircraft type first. He added that the company is focusing on dishes for 737 and A320 planes, because they serve the most number of people.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a706eb187bcf44a4add6e3e53630ce31"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Schedule driver there is regulatory approval. Has to be certified for each aircraft type. Focusing on 737 &amp; A320, as those serve most number of people, with development testing on Gulfstream.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1408565146218283014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Hofeller <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/21/spacex-starlink-vp-aviation-internet-market-ripe-for-overhaul.html">reiterated</a> SpaceX&#39;s quest to put Starlink on planes at the Satellite 2022 conference last month, saying that the company believes &quot;[c]onnectivity on airplanes is something [that&#39;s] ripe for an overhaul.&quot; He said SpaceX is developing a service that would allow every single passenger on a plane to stream content like they&#39;re able to do in their homes.</p><p>SpaceX <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/08/starlink-for-vehicles-plan-has-ruggedized-terminal-for-extreme-heat-and-cold/">filed an application</a> with the FCC in August last year for a ruggedized type of Starlink antenna that can withstand harsh environments meant for use on planes, ships and other types of moving vehicles. A couple of months later, another FCC filing had <a href="https://wccftech.com/mysterious-starlink-dish-will-test-service-on-aircraft-for-six-months/">revealed</a> that SpaceX was going to test the new &quot;mobile user terminal&quot; on an aircraft for six months.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Delta had already tested Starlink&#39;s technology, Summit Ridge Group (a consulting firm with expertise in satellite communications) founder J. Armand Musey told <em>The Journal</em> that it could take several years for SpaceX&#39;s satellite broadband to see widespread adoption. It still has to schedule time with airlines to install terminals on their planes, after all, while more established competitors are also taking steps to improve their service.&nbsp;</p> ]]>

            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Netflix might offer cheaper ad-supported plans in the coming years. In the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-loses-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings-204534571.html">most recent earnings call</a>, co-CEO Reed Hastings has <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-launching-ad-supported-plans-1235132378/">revealed</a> that the streaming giant is currently working on the offering and that it will be finalizing details for those plans &quot;over the next year or two.&quot; Hastings said he finds ads complex and he&#39;s a huge fan of the simplicity of subscriptions, but giving consumers who don&#39;t mind watching ads the option to pay less &quot;makes a lot of sense.&quot;</p><p>And it could make a lot of sense for the company, too. The service lost around 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, a development it blamed on stiffer competition, inability to expand in some territories due to technological limitations and account sharing. Apparently, 222 million households are paying for Netflix, but over 100 million more are sharing those accounts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Back in March, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-test-fee-outside-household-accounts-184722431.html">started testing</a> a feature in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru that allowed subscribers to add two &quot;sub-members,&quot; who&#39;ll get their own log-ins and profiles, for $3. It may just be a fraction of what a full membership costs, but at least Netflix is getting something from people who&#39;d normally just borrow their friends&#39; accounts.</p><p>Hastings clarified during the call that the ad-supported memberships will be added as tiers and members who don&#39;t mind paying full subscription fees don&#39;t have to be subjected to advertisements. &quot;It is pretty clear that it is working for Hulu, Disney is doing it, HBO did it. We don&#39;t have any doubt that it works,&quot; he said. The executive also added that Netflix will merely be a publisher and that it will not track user data to match ads like some of its competitors do.</p> ]]>

            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>The San Diego Padres will start wearing a Motorola logo on their sleeves, beginning with the 2023 Major League Baseball regular season. While corporate partnerships are nothing new in baseball, it’s the first time we’re seeing an MLB team with a sponsored patch. The league earlier this month said MLB teams could feature the logos of <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/mlb/major-league-baseball-announces-jersey-patch-program-teams-2023">corporate sponsors</a> on their uniforms, similar to what both the <a href="https://boardroom.tv/nba-jersey-patch-program/">NBA</a> and <a href="https://nhl.nbcsports.com/2021/09/24/capitals-become-first-nhl-team-to-sell-jersey-patch-sponsorship/#:~:text=According%20to%20Soshnick%2C%20Caesars%20is,to%20NHL%20Commissioner%20Gary%20Bettman.">NHL</a> are doing.</p><p>Beginning in 2023, the Motorola “batwing” logo will be featured on the right sleeve across versions of the Padres’ jerseys. Motorola will also outfit the Padres’ Hall of Fame with interactive technology displays and product integration throughout the exhibit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We are thrilled to partner with a quintessential and innovative brand like Motorola to bring cutting-edge technology, design, and performance to Petco Park,” Padres CEO Erik Greupner <a href="https://www.mlb.com/padres/news/padres-announce-motorola-as-official-jersey-patch-partner">said</a> in a press release. “Motorola’s iconic logo on our jersey is a perfect alignment with our Padres brand, and we look forward to teaming up to provide a great experience for our fans.”</p><p>The NBA’s jersey patch program has ended in some particularly lucrative deals — the combined value for the 2021-22 season was projected to be <a href="https://boardroom.tv/nba-jersey-patch-program/">$225 million</a>. The brands involved tend to be more unconventional than your run-of-the-mill beverage and sneaker company sponsors. A number of tech companies have sponsored jersey patches, including rebate app Ibotta, Squarespace, Vistaprint and online trading company <a href="https://www.netsdaily.com/2021/9/27/22695196/nets-sign-monster-jersey-patch-deal-with-webull-the-online-trading-app">WeBull</a>. The Philadeliphia 76ers recently entered into a <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/philadelphia-76ers-crypto-jersey-patch-sponsor-nft/">$10-million-a-year</a> jersey patch partnership with Hong Kong-based Crypto.com arena.</p><p>Motorola is also the jersey patch sponsor of three separate NBA teams; the Milwaukee Bucks, the Indiana Pacers and the Brooklyn Nets. Perhaps the biggest score for Motorola is that is now the official smartphone sponsor for all these teams. These deals could raise the Android phone maker’s profile and generate more buzz around this year’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-moto-edge-wants-to-be-a-more-affordable-galaxy-note-140020521.html">Edge+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-g-stylus-2022-release-date-price-191144555.html">Moto G Stylus</a>.</p> ]]>

            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Cre8Audio made a splash a few years ago when it launched the <a href="https://www.cre8audio.com/niftycase">NiftyCase</a> in 2019, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/eurorack/">Eurorack</a> case that featured a surprising amount of convenient features for a stunningly low price. Seriously, <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/NiftyCase--cre8-audio-niftycase-eurorack-case-with-2-channels-midi-usb-cv-gate">$200</a> for an 84hp Eurorack case with a power supply, MIDI to CV converter, MIDI over USB capabilities and audio connections is kind of bonkers. Now the company is going a little more upmarket, targeting a niche within a niche, with the <a href="https://www.cre8audio.com/niftykeyz">NiftyKeys</a>.</p><p>NiftyKeys is a full-sized 49-key MIDI keyboard with a 112hp Eurorack case mounted on top. Now, at <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/NiftyKEYZ--cre8audio-niftykeyz-keyboard-and-eurorack-case">$600</a> it&#39;s a decent investment, especially considering you still have to fill it up with modules. But the only comparable product I can think of is the now discontinued <a href="https://waldorfmusic.com/en/kb37">Waldorf kb37</a> which retailed for $999 and was smaller and less feature packed than the NiftyKeys. Which means, it&#39;s actually something of a bargain?&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7639090ca789402fb1ecdcaf574c1b5d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfjzWCHwaIw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There are four paired CV pitch and gate outs across the top which means you can patch up a four-voice polyphonic synth, or four separate monophonic patches playable split across different zones of the keyboard, or a pair of duophonic patches, or... you get the idea. There&#39;s also CV outs for aftertouch, velocity, modwheel, expression or the clock-synced LFO. There&#39;s an internal clock, but the whole rig can also be clocked externally, even over MIDI. There&#39;s five-pin MIDI In and Out/Through, plus MIDI over USB. Plus the keyboard itself has an auto-chord feature, a multi-mode arpeggiator, glide and swing control.&nbsp;</p><p></p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ Netflix isn't blaming the pandemic recovery for its lost subscribers ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Netflix may have benefitted from the COVID-19 pandemic, but it&#39;s not blaming its latest troubles on people leaving their homes. The company has <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/FINAL-Q1-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">revealed</a> that it lost about 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, a sharp contrast from the millions of additions per quarter over the past year. However, the streaming giant said that the pandemic only &quot;obscured the picture&quot; — there were multiple problems hiding under the surface.</p><p>The company pointed to stiffer competition from online services like Disney+ and Prime Video. While Netflix has still been gaining share at a modest rate, it wants to grow &quot;faster.&quot; The firm also blamed limited room to expand in many countries due to both technology factors outside of its control (such as smart TV adoption and data prices) and the abundance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-test-fee-outside-household-accounts-184722431.html">account sharing</a>. There are more than 222 million paying households, Netflix said, but another 100 million-plus sharing those accounts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-suspends-service-russia-211753761.html">halt service in Russia</a> also helped swing Netflix from growth to a loss. It would have added 500,000 customers, but ultimately lost 700,000 after dropping its Russian base in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was still &quot;soft&quot; across all regions, however.</p><p>Netflix outlined multiple efforts to turn things around. It hoped to improve the quality of its shows, profit from sharing (such as an option for paid sharing in Latin America) and produce more content to suit audiences outside the US, where growth was stronger.</p><p>These results might not pay off in the short term. Netflix still expects either mild growth (no more than 1.5 million new members) or a loss (up to 2 million) in the ongoing second quarter. With that said, Netflix is clearly under no illusion that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-mobile-stranger-things-android-ios-171232076.html">mobile games</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-let-you-give-shows-a-two-thumbs-up-160048116.html">minor feature additions</a> will be enough to spark renewed interest by themselves — its fundamentals need to improve if it&#39;s going to fend off rivals.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p>Amazon will perform a racial equity audit of its nearly one million hourly employees, the company said last week in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000110465922045572/tm223357-5_def14a.htm">statement</a> to shareholders.

                <![CDATA[ e audit, which will be led by former US Attorney General Loretta Lynch and released to the public. But some critics say the audit should extend to the corporate level, instead of Amazon’s traditionally more diverse warehouse workers.</p><p>“Before you applaud this step, read the fine print. This audit will not include Amazon’s negative practices impacting Black employees at the corporate level. That’s a major carve out,” <a href="https://twitter.com/charnewman">tweeted</a> tech entrepreneur Charlotte Newman, a former corporate employee who once sued the company for racial and gender discrimination.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon made clear that the purpose of the audit would be to study if there was any disparate racial impacts from its policies. &quot;The focus of the audit will be to evaluate any disparate racial impacts on our nearly one million US hourly employees resulting from our policies, programs and practices,&quot; the company said in its statement.</p><p>The decision <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-investors-reject-new-york-retirement-funds-call-for-a-racial-equity-audit-10-other-shareholder-proposals-11622242863?mod=mw_latestnews&amp;link=sfmw_tw">comes</a> after Amazon investors rejected 11 proposals from shareholders, including ones focused on racial equity and diversity at the company. One of the rejected proposals would invite an hourly employee to join Amazon’s board.</p><p>“Amazon’s board lacks representation from hourly employees, who thoroughly understand the company’s daily operations. Women and racial minorities, which constitute a large percentage of Amazon’s hourly associates, are also comparatively underrepresented at the board level, which remains predominantly male and white,” wrote the proposal’s author.</p><p>Amazon’s board of directors recommended against voting for the proposal. “Our current process to identify and nominate directors has successfully recruited diverse and qualified directors with extensive human capital management experience,” wrote the board.</p><p>Another rejected proposal called for a more extensive racial audit of Amazon’s corporate and hourly workforce. A large percentage of Amazon’s hourly associates are women and racial minorities and its corporate workforce is overwhelmingly white. Nearly 60 percent of Amazon’s lowest-paid hourly workers are Black or Hispanic, according to a 2021 <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazons-workforce-split-sharply-along-the-lines-of-race-gender-and-pay-new-data-indicates/">company report</a> that looked at the past two years of demographic data. More than half of Amazon’s hourly workers are women. Meanwhile, Amazon’s highest-paid workers are white or Asian and male.</p><p>The company has faced <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/19/22444177/amazon-five-more-lawsuits-employees-allege-race-and-gender-discrimination-charlotte-newman">multiple lawsuits</a> from former and current employees who allege they faced race and gender discrimination at work. Back in February, a New York federal judge dismissed a <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/amazon-class-action-lawsuit-and-settlement-news/amazon-racial-discrimination-class-action-dismissed/">class action racial discrimination lawsuit</a> made by a former Amazon warehouse manager regarding its Covid-19 policies.</p><p>Amazon plans to hold its annual shareholder’s meeting on May 25th, where investors will vote on a number of proposals on racial equity and healthcare. Amazon has advised shareholders to vote against a proposal that would call for a full, top-down racial equity audit of the entire company.</p><p>“There is no public evidence that Amazon is assessing the potential or actual negative impacts of its polices, practices, products and services through a racial equity lens,” <a href="https://www.ezodproxy.com/amazon/2022/proxy/HTML1/amazon_proxy2022_0083.htm">stated</a> the shareholder’s proposal.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ Nitecore’s new Sony camera battery charges through built-in USB-C ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Every year, companies like Canon and Nikon push camera technology forward with new models that add features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-9-mirrorless-camera-review-143006924.html">8K video</a> recording and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">30 fps shooting speeds</a>. But the batteries powering those cameras haven’t changed nearly as much during the mirrorless era.</p><p>Enter Chinese manufacturer Nitecore with its newly announced replacement for Sony’s NP-FZ100. Spotted by <a href="http://sonyaddict.com/2022/04/17/new-nitecore-ufz100-battery-with-intigrated-usb-c-charger/"><em>Sony Addict</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and later <a href="https://gizmodo.com/camera-battery-with-usb-c-charging-port-1848806373"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>, the <a href="https://photo.nitecore.com/product/ufz100">UFZ100</a> features a built-in USB-C port so that you don’t need to use a proprietary Sony power adapter to charge it. The battery also includes a handy LED indicator to tell you when it’s below 10 percent charge. That same LED will indicate when the UFZ100 is below half power, above 50 percent and finally fully topped up, with a constant green light indicating the final state. With a 2,250mAh capacity, it’s only slightly smaller than Sony’s 2,280mAh NP-FZ100 and works with many of the company’s most recent camera models, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html">A6600</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">A7 IV</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>USB-C charging has been a standard feature on Sony cameras for a few years now, so it’s not like you couldn’t live without one of the company’s proprietary power adapters before. But having a USB-C port on the battery does make things more convenient since you don’t need access to a wall outlet. With enough cables, you could also more easily charge multiple batteries simultaneously.</p><p>One thing we don’t know about the UFZ100 yet is how much it will cost. Third-party battery manufacturers tend to price their offerings lower than Sony, Canon and Nikon to entice consumers to buy their products, but the added USC-C port on the UFZ100 could make it more expensive.</p> ]]>

The company has <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/presence-platforms-hand-tracking-api-gets-an-upgrade/">upgraded</a> its Presence Platform hand tracking support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest headset</a> apps to allow considerably more natural gestures, particularly those involving hand-over-hand interactions. You can now clap your hands, provide a truer-to-life thumbs-up and deliver high-fives — you can show your appreciation without reaching for your controllers.</p><div id="9e449fcc8e504b0e8430e2d21533d28f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/frG4fM5Df_A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The update also provides more consistent tracking, including for fast movements like waving. Meta chalked up the improvements to new AI-based approaches, including deep learning that&#39;s better at understanding your hand poses when the cameras have only a limited view.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will take a while before Quest apps can take full advantage of the improved hand tracking, although Meta is promising relatively little work. However, it&#39;s easy to see the practical improvements. Many VR apps ask you to avoid certain gestures. After this upgrade, though, you can use your hands more like you would in real life. Don&#39;t be surprised if you see more apps and games that let you go controller-free.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p>Nearly two decades into the life of <em>World of Warcraft</em>, Blizzard has just announced the MMO’s ninth expansion. <a href="https://dragonflight.blizzard.com/en-us/"><em><ins>Dragonflight</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will allow players to explore the Dragon Isles, the ancestral home of Azer ]]>
                <![CDATA[ oth’s dragonflights. It’s been a while since WoW’s shapeshifting dragons have been the star of its narrative. A cinematic trailer the studio released today recounts the history of the continent.</p><div id="10dde4a67f7b4d93b06698aade6eec03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZtedjN1JXY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Consisting of five new zones, the Dragon Isles will introduce the Dracthyr, a new playable race of dragons that can take on a humanoid form. Dracthyr characters can join either the Alliance or Horde, and they’re the only race that can access the expansion’s new Evoker class. As an Evoker, you can either specialize in healing your allies or fighting as a mid-range damage dealer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Dragonflight</em> will also introduce Dragonriding. While <em>World of Warcraft</em> has had flying mounts since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wow-classic-burning-crusade-223049452.html"><ins>2007’s Burning Crusade</ins></a>, the new expansion looks to add more dynamism to the activity with special maneuvers drakes can execute while in the air. For instance, you can pull off a swooping divebomb to quickly descend down the edge of a cliff.</p><p>In addition to those features, Blizzard said the expansion will ship with quality of life improvements, including a redesigned user interface players can personalize to their liking. There’s also a new talent system for class customization and tweaks to the game’s crafting mechanics.</p><p><em>World of Warcraft Dragonflight </em>does not have a release date yet but expect Blizzard to share more information about the expansion in the coming weeks and months. The studio announced today it also plans to rerelease 2008’s <a href="https://wowclassic.blizzard.com/en-us/">Wrath of the Lich King</a><em>&nbsp;</em>for <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ MIT scientists reveal why it's hard to evenly split Oreo filling between two halves ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mit/">MIT</a> created a 3D-printed device to develop a better understanding of the science behind what happens to the cream filling when you split the two sides of an Oreo cookie. Their device, the Oreometer, uses rubber bands and coins to control the torque applied to each side as a cookie is twisted apart. Adding pennies to one side rotates one of the two chambers and separates the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oreo/">Oreo</a>.</p><p>After testing various types of Oreos, the researchers added scientific weight to something that nearly every American over the age of three already knows: the cream filling usually sticks to one side, even with Double and Mega Stuf varieties. Twisting speed mattered, according to the team — if you try to do it quickly, it may take more strain and stress to split a cookie. Curiously, the scientists found that the cream only separated more evenly when testing older boxes of cookies.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The researchers suspect the Oreo manufacturing process is one reason for the phenomenon. “Videos of the manufacturing process show that they put the first wafer down, then dispense a ball of cream onto that wafer before putting the second wafer on top,” Crystal Owens, an MIT mechanical engineering PhD candidate, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/oreometer-cream-0419">said</a>. “Apparently that little time delay may make the cream stick better to the first wafer.”</p><div id="7fc862c5661f421c8e0e7b348401f6a3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_gaJ4po_Nw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The team published a paper on their research in the journal <em>Physics of Fluids</em>. As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oreometer-oreo-cookie-device-1848811412"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> notes, they conducted the experiment as an exercise in rheology, which is the study of how matter flows.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers determined that, based on how the filling responded to stress, it should be classified as &quot;mushy&quot; instead of brittle, tough or rubbery. They also found that the cream&#39;s failure stress — the force per area needed to deform the filling or make it flow — is around the same as mozzarella cheese and double that of peanut butter and cream cheese.</p><p>There could be some other practical benefits of the research. “My 3D printing fluids are in the same class of materials as Oreo cream,” Owens said. “So, this new understanding can help me better design ink when I’m trying to print flexible electronics from a slurry of carbon nanotubes, because they deform in almost exactly the same way.”</p><p>In addition, Owens suggested that if the inside of each Oreo half had more texture, it might have a better grip on the cream and the filling would be more even when a cookie&#39;s twisted apart “As they are now, we found there’s no trick to twisting that would split the cream evenly,” Owens added.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to try the experiment yourself, you can <a href="https://github.com/crystalowens/oreometer/">download the 3D printer files</a>. Just be sure to eat some of the separated Oreos afterward. For science.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-11-nasa-life-detecting-europa-lander-concept.html">Europa&#39;s potential to support life</a> may have increased thanks to geographic observations. <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/europas-similarity-greenland-hints-that-jupiter-moon-could-harbor-life-2022-04-19/">notes</a> researchers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29458-3">discovered</a> similarities between double ridges on the Jovian moon&#39;s surface and smaller-scale equivalents in Greenland. As the Greenland ridges were formed by subsurface water that refroze, this suggests Europa&#39;s counterparts formed the same way. That, in turn, would indicate large volumes of the liquid water necessary to support life similar to that on Earth.</p><p>The geographic features are not only common on Europa, but are large enough that the water pockets for these ridges would each be comparable in size to North America&#39;s Lake Erie. They&#39;d also be relatively shallow (about 0.6 miles below the surface), putting them near other chemicals that could help form life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are still no direct signs of life on Europa, and there might not be for a long time. NASA is launching its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-europa-clipper-mission-jupiters-040804303.html">Europa Clipper</a> spacecraft in 2024, but it won&#39;t reach orbit until 2030. Even so, the Greenland comparison bolsters the case for investigating Jupiter&#39;s fourth-largest moon. It suggests that at least some conditions are well-suited to life, even if factors like the extreme cold (a maximum -260F at the equator) limit what&#39;s possible.</p> ]]>

            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media studio is working on not one but two new games with Disney. Following last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-marvel-partnership-172714404.html"><ins>Marvel announcement</ins></a>, Hennig and company <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/amy-hennig-skydance-new-media-star-wars-game">revealed</a> today they’re working on a AAA Star Wars game with Lucasfilm Games. And just like the studio’s Marvel collaboration, fans can expect a “narrative-driven, action-adventure” experience. Lucasfilm Games said the title would tell a new original story set within the Star Wars galaxy but offered few other details on the project, including a release date or target platforms.</p><div id="3e056b1d374541cab3a1fbdd0b1d5896"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Never tell me the odds.<a href="https://t.co/np8zSBMkdd">https://t.co/np8zSBMkdd</a></p>— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) <a href="https://twitter.com/amy_hennig/status/1516448649588330496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig, whose previous credits include the Uncharted series from Naughty Dog. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Hennig, Tuesday’s announcement marks a return to the Star Wars franchise. Before founding Skydance New Media, she worked at EA’s Visceral Games studio on a Star Wars game that was ultimately canceled by the publisher. Her game is one of a handful of new Star Wars titles currently in development. Respawn Entertainment is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-respawn-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-sequel-first-person-shooter-strategy-151119884.html"><ins>working on three new games</ins></a>, including a sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-two-week-sales.html"><em><ins>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</ins></em></a>. Fans can also look forward to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-eclipse-quantic-dream-trailer-014713202.html"><em><ins>Star Wars: Eclipse</ins></em></a> from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-24-detroit-become-human-ps4-review.html"><em><ins>Detroit: Become Human</ins></em></a> developer Quantic Dream.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/"><ins>Instagram</ins></a> is rolling out the option to create and donate to fundraisers through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/reels/"><ins>Reels</ins></a>. Users in more than 30 countries can now add a link for people to donate to more than 1.5 million nonprofits. The fundraiser tool has been available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-19-instagram-launch-fundraising-sticker-stories-donation.html"><ins>in Stories</ins></a> and on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-live-fundraisers-140042841.html"><ins>livestreams</ins></a> for the past couple of years.</p><p>The feature <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/make-an-impact-for-earth-day/"><ins>was announced</ins></a> as part of Meta&#39;s Earth Day efforts. Meta says that more than 4 million people have donated over $150 million through Instagram and Facebook to support environmental protection and nonprofits fighting against climate change. The most popular environmental causes, based on the overall number of donors, are The Ocean Cleanup, World Wildlife Fund and (one that&#39;s close to my heart) Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most donations made on Instagram last year were under $20. Meta covers the payment processing fees for charitable fundraisers, so every penny that users donate goes to nonprofits.</p><p>Elsewhere, Meta announced that it&#39;s adding more features to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-climate-change-information-center-121525353.html">Climate Science Center</a>. It will highlight actions people can take in their day-to-day lives to combat climate change. The center will also shine a spotlight on data visualizations showing country-level emissions. The Climate Science Center is now available in 150 countries.</p><p>Across Instagram, Facebook and Messenger, Meta has released stickers and profile frames to help people show their support for environmental causes. In addition, the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/climate-misinformation-grant"><ins>revealed</ins></a> the nine organizations that will receive funding from a $1 million grant program to help them fight climate misinformation. Meta also announced the <a href="https://www.ebimpact.org/programmes/sustainability-media-academy"><ins>Sustainability Media Academy</ins></a>, a project to help Asia-based journalists build expertise and develop authority on sustainability issues.</p> ]]>

            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Apple Store employees attempting to form a union at the company’s flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-grand-central-terminal-191315560.html">Grand Central Terminal location</a> in New York City want the tech giant to pay workers at least $30 per hour. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/18/apple-new-york-retail-union-organizers-want-workers-paid-at-least-30-per-hour.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the group leading the effort, Fruit Stand Workers United, made the request on Monday in an update posted to its <a href="https://fsworkersunited.org/&#39;">website</a>.</p><p>“For pay, we seek a minimum $30 for all workers, built up on a matrix based on role, tenure and performance,” the group said. “For benefits, we seek more robust changes, like increased tuition reimbursement, faster accrued and more vacation time, and better retirement options, including higher match rates for 401(k) and enrollment into pension plans.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/16/apple-grand-central-station-retail-union-workers-united/"><em>The</em><em>Washington Post</em></a>, the first outlet to report on the Grand Central Terminal unionization effort, Apple pays retail employees between $17 and up to $30 per hour, depending on their role, experience and location. “We are fortunate to have incredible retail team members and we deeply value everything they bring to Apple,” the company said. “We are pleased to offer very strong compensation and benefits for full time and part time employees, including health care, tuition reimbursement, new parental leave, paid family leave, annual stock grants and many other benefits.”</p><p>Organizers with Fruit Stand Workers United recently began collecting signatures from their co-workers. If at least 30 percent of the approximately 270 eligible employees at the store express interest in forming a union, the group can file with the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election. At least three other stores are attempting to form a union, according to <em>The Post</em>.</p><p>At the start of the year, Apple announced it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-raises-benefits-000123583.html">offer additional benefits</a> to all of its US retail employees. As of April 4th, the company’s expanded benefits include increased vacation and sick days, paid parental leave and more. Like many other retailers throughout the pandemic, Apple has had a time tough hiring and retaining frontline workers. Over that same period, the company’s retail employees have complained of difficult working conditions, including issues with low pay, stressful workloads due to staffing shortages and poor morale.</p> ]]>

            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>You no longer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-health-checklist-mandatory-masks-174840548.html">need to wear a mask</a> to ride with Uber or Lyft n the US. Uber has <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/safety/">dropped</a> mask requirements for US drivers and passengers as of today (April 19th). Lyft, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/update-to-lyfts-health-safety-guidelines">announced</a> that mask wearing is now optional in the country. Both ridesharing firms now let you sit in the front passenger seat, although Uber said this should only be done if a party is too large to fit exclusively in the back.</p><p>Uber stressed that the CDC still recommends masks for people who either have some &quot;risk factors&quot; for COVID-19 or live in areas where there are high virus transmission levels. Lyft also noted that some local governments might still require masks, but it no longer accepts health safety as a reason for cancelling a trip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decisions aren&#39;t voluntary. A federal judge in Florida <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-rules-mask-mandate-transport-unlawful-overturning-biden-effort-2022-04-18/">overturned</a> a federal mandate for masks aboard public transportation on Monday, leading major airlines and Amtrak to drop their requirements. Some public transit systems (such as those in New Jersey and Washington, DC) have also lifted their demands. Uber and Lyft are just following suit, in other words. It&#39;s not yet clear if the federal government will challenge the ruling.</p><p>The move won&#39;t be welcome by everyone. The pandemic is still ongoing, and people who are immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk may be particularly reluctant to avoid cars with maskless drivers. These travellers now have fewer options for getting around, and may have to rely on friends or family to minimize the chances of an infection.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p>The Instant Pot may be the most popular and ubiquitous multicooker, but it&#39;s certainly not the only option. Companies like Ninja now make their own multicookers that can hold their own against the various Instant Pot models out there, and now you can pick up one of Ninja&#39;s most capable machines at a near record-low price. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ninja Foodi 10-in-1 multicooker" href="https://amzn.to/36rxHa7">Ninja Foodi 10-in-1 multicooker</a> is on sale for $130, or $70 off its normal price and only $10 more than its all-time low that we saw at the end of last year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/36rxHa7" id="c0e6b874c95842baad13199f00e13eed" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ninja 10-in-1 multicooker at Amazon - $130</a><p>As the name suggests, this model supports 10 cooking modes, including pressure cook, slow cook, steam, dehydrates and more. Among those is an air-fry mode, which isn&#39;t something all multicookers have, and the machine uses Ninja&#39;s &quot;TenderCrisp Technology&quot; to lock in juices using pressure cooking and then crisp the outside just before finishing. This multicooker has a 6.5-quart capacity, which is big enough to make a whole meal for a mid- to large-sized family, and it can fit a whole, five-pound chicken or a six-pound roast easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Generally, you&#39;ll find the best deals on these devices during the holiday shopping period, but this discount is a good one if you want to add a device like this to your kitchen immediately.

                <![CDATA[ Apple products were made with 50 percent more recycled material last year ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Apple is boasting of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-environmental-progress-report-iphone-12-power-adapter-144626760.html">environmental initiatives</a> ahead of Earth Day, and it&#39;s shedding new light on its devices in the process. As part of its 2022 Environmental Progress <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2022.pdf">Report</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-expands-the-use-of-recycled-materials-across-its-products/">revealed</a> that 18 percent of the material in its fiscal 2021 products was recycled or renewed, the &quot;highest-ever&quot; ratio at the iPhone maker and a 50 percent jump from <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2021.pdf">last year&#39;s</a> 12 percent. There were eight new products including at least 20 percent recycled material. This included the company&#39;s first use of certified recycled gold (in the mainboards and camera arrays of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">13 Pro</a>), while reuses of cobalt, rare earth elements and tungsten &quot;more than doubled&quot; over the year.</p><p>The tech firm also said it had cut nearly all use of plastics in its packaging. The material represented just 4 percent of packaging in 2021, and the new iPhones were the company&#39;s first handsets without any plastic packing material. Apple hopes to eliminate all use of plastic in its packaging by 2025.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report not-so-subtly advertised Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">response to repairability concerns</a>. The company noted that its its products have become increasingly easier to fix at repair centers, and use more durable designs. It mentioned the announcement of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">Self Service Repair program</a>, although it wasn&#39;t more specific about the 2022 launch window.</p><p>Apple has been eager to share its eco-friendly goals in the past, including plans to make both its products and the supply chain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-carbon-neutral-supply-chain-2030-134922154.html">carbon neutral by 2030</a>. Critics have argued that highly publicized efforts like these sometimes represent &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html">greenwashing</a>&quot; that masks the overall environmental harm of their products (such as shipping hundreds of millions of devices per year). However, it&#39;s still good to know that the hardware you buy won&#39;t deal quite as severe a blow as it would have in the past.</p> ]]>

            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>That tiny webcam on your laptop has probably gotten more use in the last few years than it ever has before. Even if you’re back to taking some of your meetings in the office, chances are that back-to-back Zoom calls are now a permanent part of your professional life. Once an afterthought, your ]]>
                <![CDATA[ computer’s webcam has become one of its most important components — and the fact remains that most built-in cameras are not able to provide consistent, high-quality video chat experiences.</p><p>This is where external webcams come in. They can do wonders for those with lackluster built-in webcams, people who spend most of their working hours on video conferences, and those who picked up a new hobby of streaming on Twitch or YouTube over the past couple of years. But as with most PC accessories, it can be tough to sort through the sea of options out there. We tested out a bunch of the latest webcams to see which are worth your money and which you can safely skip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What to look for in a webcam</h2><h3>Resolution and field of view</h3><p>While some newer machines have 1080p webcams, most built-in cameras have a resolution of 720p, so you’ll want to look for an external one that’s better than that. FHD webcams will give you a noticeable bump in video quality; ideally, you’re looking for something that can handle 1080p at 60fps or 30fps. If you’re considering a cheap 720p webcam, make sure to get one that supports at least 30fps (most will) or, even better, 60fps. However, if your primary concern is looking better during video calls, 1080p is the way to go.</p><p>Some webcams can shoot in 4K, but that’s overkill for most people. Not to mention most video conferencing services like Zoom, Google Meet and Skype don’t even support 4K video. When it comes to streaming, Twitch maxes out at 1080p video, but YouTube added <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/4k-live-streaming-live-has-never-looked/">4K live streaming</a> back in 2016. Ultimately, with 4K webcam shots having such limited use, most people can get by with a solid 1080p camera.</p><p>Field of view controls how much can fit in the frame when you’re recording. Most webcams I tested had a default field of view of around 78 degrees, which was enough to capture me and enough of my background to show that I really need to organize my home office. On cheaper webcams you’ll usually see narrower fields of view (around 60 degrees), and those aren’t necessarily bad. They won’t show as much of your background, but that also means you won’t be able to squeeze as many friends or family members into frame when you’re having Zoom birthday parties. On the flip side, more expensive webcams may let you adjust the field of view to be even wider than average.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/02284fb0-a11a-11eb-aafb-70e6f3b5aa36" alt="Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam clipped onto a computer monitor with cork boards hanging on the wall behind it." data-uuid="0dce5f43-5d80-35c3-9a7b-46d3c50a37bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Autofocus and other “auto” features</h3><p>Webcams with autofocus will keep you looking sharp without much work on your part. You should be able to move around, step back and forth, and remain in focus the whole time. Some models let you manually adjust focus, too, if you have specific needs. Devices with fixed focus are less convenient, but they tend to be more affordable.</p><p>In the same vein is auto framing, a feature that some high-end webcams now offer. Similarly to Apple’s Center Stage feature, the camera automatically adjusts to keep you in the center of the frame even as you move around. But you’ll pay a premium for it: The only two webcams I tested that had auto framing were the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:$200 Dell UltraSharp webcam" href="https://bit.ly/3NWh8Um">$200 Dell UltraSharp webcam</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$220 Anker Video Bar" href="https://amzn.to/3ukjtB6">$220 Anker Video Bar</a>, and while that helped those models stand out from the pack, neither were great enough to earn a spot in our best picks list.</p><p>You’ll also see other “auto” features listed in webcam specs, most notably auto light correction. This will adjust the camera’s settings to make up for a dimly lit room. If you don’t have a well-lit setup for your video calls, or often take calls in different places where you can’t control the lighting, this feature will be valuable.</p><h3>Microphones</h3><p>Most webcams have built-in microphones that, depending on your setup, might end up being closer to you than your computer’s own mics. Check to see if the model you’re considering has mono or stereo mics, as the latter is better. Some even use noise-reduction technology to keep your voice loud and clear. While audiophiles and streamers will want to invest in a standalone microphone, most others can get by using a webcam’s built-in mic.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>There aren’t a ton of fascinating breakthroughs when it comes to webcam design. Most are round or rectangular devices that clip onto a monitor or your laptop screen. Some have the ability to screw onto a tripod stand and others can simply sit on your desk beside your computer. But unless you really like having people stare up your nose, the latter isn’t ideal. We recommend clipping your webcam to your monitor and ensuring that it’s at or slightly above eye level.</p><p>A few webcams go above and beyond by adding hardware extras like built-in lights and lens covers, too. The former can help you stand out in a dark room, while the latter makes it so hackers can’t view you through your webcam without your knowledge.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Most external webcams that are just good enough to be a step up from your computer’s built-in camera cost between $60 and $150. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use.</p><p>Spending $150 or more means you might get advanced features like 4K resolution, vertical and horizontal recording options, stereo mics, customizable video settings and more. But unless you’re spending hours on video calls each day or streaming multiple times each week, you can safely skip most of those high-end options.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h2>Best overall: Logitech C920s Pro HD</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/d2f79f70-a119-11eb-9f9f-9cfa9170c2ea" alt="Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam clipped onto a computer monitor with cork boards hanging on the wall behind it." data-uuid="81315c2c-19c2-3c96-9c81-a8f69016db07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Logitech C920s Pro HD" href="https://fave.co/380gEw8">Logitech C920s Pro HD</a> webcam seems like a great value on paper, and it proves that to be true, too, once you take it out of the box. For around $60, you’re getting an FHD webcam that can shoot in up to 1080p/30fps, has a 78-degree field-of-view, dual microphones and auto light correction. It’s a fairly average-looking webcam measuring 3.7 inches at its widest point, with the lens in the middle and its two microphones on either side.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/380gEw8" id="480558a96dae42ef8212c1fe21f8547d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Logitech C920s Pro HD at B&amp;H - $70</a><p>The adjustable base is quite sturdy and, while I kept it hooked to my external monitor most of the time, you could easily attach it to your laptop’s screen or sit it on your desk and angle the camera upward. There’s also a hole on the underside if you wish to connect it to a tripod. There’s an optional lens cover in the box that provides protection when you transport the webcam, but also gives you extra privacy.</p><p>I immediately saw an improvement in video quality when I took conference calls using the C920s Pro HD. I’m lucky enough to have one lamp and one large window in my small home office, so I’m usually not fighting for good light. But even on cloudy days, the camera’s 1080p video was sharp and produced fairly accurate colors. While cheaper cameras struggled on rainy days with the lamp off, the C920s Pro HD illuminated my whole face and had minimal shadows.</p><p>All Logitech webcams can use the company’s Camera Settings app to adjust things like field of view, brightness, color intensity and autofocus, but I kept the default settings on this one. The C920s Pro HD does have autofocus and it was so good that I barely noticed it. I was always in focus during my video chats and I never saw the camera struggling to regain focus even if I moved around.</p><h2>Runner Up: Anker PowerConf C200</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/87314390-b67e-11ec-b1cb-1cbf3c4e6c8b" alt="Anker PowerConf C200 webcam" data-uuid="0b508c63-1a2c-3e02-8494-589fa86c879d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>Anker’s cube-like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PowerConf C200 webcam" href="https://amzn.to/3CZdTXr">PowerConf C200 webcam</a> has a lot of the same perks as Logitech’s C920s Pro HD, along with a few extras and a price tag that’s $10 more. Setup is equally as easy as with the Logitech cam – just plug it into your computer or docking station and start using it. You can download the AnkerWork software to edit things like brightness, sharpness and contrast ratio and, as with Logitech’s, I kept all of those settings at their defaults.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3CZdTXr" id="ab78bf285fe54f50a6faa3de5c450e6a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerConf C200 at Amazon - $70</a><p>But you’re also able to control the camera’s resolution and field of view with this software, too. The C200 webcam defaults to a 2K resolution, but you can bring it down to 1080p, 720p or even 360p if you wish. Same goes for field of view: The default is 95 degrees, but I bumped mine down to 78 degrees to spare my colleagues a wider view of my messy home office.</p><p>I was immediately impressed with the C200’s video quality: 2K is likely more than most people need (1080p should do just fine), but the extra sharpness and clarity is a nice touch. The webcam’s autofocus is quite fast, and its larger f/2.0 aperture captures more light so you stay illuminated even in darker settings.</p><p>In addition to a built-in lens cover that you can slide closed for privacy, the C200 has dual stereo mics that actually do a good job of capturing your voice loud and clear. You can also choose directional or omnidirectional vocal pickup in the AnkerWork settings, with the latter being better if you have multiple people speaking on your end.</p><p>My biggest complaints about the C200 webcam are that it’s a bit cumbersome to adjust its angle when it’s perched on your monitor or screen. Unlike most other webcams, Anker’s doesn’t have a short neck of sorts that connects the camera to its adjustable base – it’s just one, chunky piece of plastic that I had to use both hands to adjust when necessary. Also, the C200 comes with a USB cable that’s much shorter than others. This won’t be a problem if you’re connecting the webcam directly to your laptop, but it’s not as flexible if you have a standing desk converter or a more complicated setup that requires long cables.</p><h2>Best for streaming: Logitech Streamcam</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/b046f360-9ed3-11eb-8ee2-a76d1172f5ba" alt="Logitech Streamcam clipped to a computer monitor with a cork board in the background." data-uuid="ae69b1d0-387c-31de-bb16-7ad79887bfbc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>Of all the webcams I tested, I had the most fun using <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Streamcam" href="https://amzn.to/3Ih3PtQ">Logitech’s Streamcam</a>. While it’s a bit weird to say I “had fun” with such an innocuous piece of tech, I found the Streamcam to be remarkable in many ways. First and foremost, the video quality is excellent: It shoots in 1080p/60fps and its video is slightly sharper than that of the Logitech C920s Pro HD. Details in my clothing came through much better and, whether I liked it or not, so did some of the texture on my skin. The Streamcam was also one of the best devices when it came to color reproduction.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Ih3PtQ" id="46aa8c9eeb5d4545bf79843f1e546844" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Logitech Streamcam at Amazon - $170</a><p>All of those perks remain the same even when you’re shooting in low-light conditions. The Streamcam’s auto-exposure feature made up for the darkness in my office on gloomy days. And it has the best kind of autofocus — the kind that you never notice in action.</p><p>The dual omnidirectional mics inside the Streamcam delivered my voice loud and clear during video calls. If you stream often and find yourself without an external mic, it’s nice to know that you could get by with the Streamcam’s built-in ones in a pinch. The microphones also have noise reduction to keep your voice font and center.</p><p>As far as design goes, the Streamcam is a bit larger than most. It’s a chunky almost-square that can easily be positioned on a monitor or on a tripod, and a unique feature of its design is its ability to shoot either vertically or horizontally. I kept mine in the standard 16:9 format, but some streamers who post to social media often will like the 9:16 format that’s best for Instagram and TikTok. Logitech also made sure the Streamcam was optimized for Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), XSplit and Streamlabs, so you can use it directly out of the box for your next live session.</p><p>The Streamcam is the best all-purpose webcam on our list; if you want one device that can do it all, from video conferences to Twitch streams to family video chats, the Streamcam is the best option. However, not everyone will want to drop the $170 on one. Its higher price keeps it from our top spot because those who just want to look better on Zoom calls don’t need to drop $170 to do that.</p><h2>Best premium: Logitech Brio</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/ef2cf0c0-9ed3-11eb-b197-0c8a86b18a9e" alt="Logitech Brio webcam clipped to a computer monitor with a cork board in the background." data-uuid="c15c8027-df4a-355b-9100-4dbc549a3e66"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re willing to spare no expense on a webcam, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s $200 Brio" href="https://amzn.to/3tVTe2k">Logitech’s $200 Brio</a> is the one to get. It has a lot of things going for it, but the best and most important feature is its 4K recording. It’s capable of shooting in 4K/30fps in addition to 1080p and 720p in either 60fps or 30fps. I kept it set at 4K and I never looked better on a video call. My feed was sharp and clear, and the only negative thing about it was the slightly inaccurate colors (they came off more saturated than normal).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3tVTe2k" id="ccbf4228608647a2bd6263bf492aaee0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Logitech Brio at Amazon - $200</a><p>Low-light performance was stellar as well. The Brio’s light correcting technology with HDR made up for the cave-like environment in which I was sometimes forced to record. As far as sound goes, the dual microphones inside the Brio were some of the loudest and clearest of any webcam I tested. They also use noise-canceling technology to capture audio from up to one meter away while blocking out background noise.</p><p>The Brio also had the most customizable settings of the Logitech cameras I tried. In addition to brightness, contrast, color intensity, white balance and autofocus, you’re able to adjust HDR, field of view and image ratio in the Camera Settings app. While I kept most of the default settings, I changed my field of view from 65 degrees to 78 degrees (the third option of 90 degrees was too wide for my taste), and it captured just enough of my background but still kept me as the focal point.</p><p>I also opted to turn off autofocus because I found it to be finicky. Issues with the Brio’s autofocus have been documented online and I’ve reached out to Logitech for troubleshooting tips. An Engadget colleague who uses the Brio as his daily webcam hasn’t experienced the autofocus issues, so there just might not be enough contrast between myself and the background. Since I take most video calls from my home office desk, adjusting the focus manually to fit that environment worked well for me.</p><p>It’s hard to get excited about webcam design, but Logitech tried to make the Brio as sleek looking as possible. Instead of a mere rectangle, the Brio is an elongated oval with rounded edges and a standard base that clips securely onto a screen. The front is a glossy black, punctuated only by the camera lens, two tiny slits for the microphones and the IR sensors. The latter makes the Brio compatible with Windows Hello, so you can unlock your system using facial recognition. And when you want more privacy, you can use the included lens shade to cover the camera.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ Apple's 14-inch MacBook Pro is back down to a record low of $1,749 ]]>
            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>The 2021 MacBook Pros were some of the best laptops we came across last year, but as to be expected, they come with high price tags. Right now, you can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-inch MacBook Pro" href="https://amzn.to/37uKjxF">14-inch MacBook Pro</a> for $250 cheaper than usual at Amazon. The price has already been discounted by $50, but an addition $200 automatically applied coupon brings the machine down to a record low of $1,749.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/37uKjxF" id="d6311044dfe141caba929750fc2ad7c3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 14-inch MacBook Pro (512GB) at Amazon - $1,749</a><p>This particular model comes with Apple&#39;s M1 Pro chip, which features an 8‑core CPU and 14‑core GPU, plus 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The performance gains provided by specs like this was one reason why both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">score of 92</a> from us when we reviewed them last year. Not only will they be able to handle anything you throw at them, but they also have the stamina to last most of the day. We clocked a 12.5-hour battery life for the 14-inch model in our testing and a 16.5-hour battery life on the 16-inch laptop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the MacBook Pro looks fairly similar to previous models, Apple fixed a few long-standing issues — namely, the lack of ports. The new machines have three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI connector, a headphone jack, an SD card slot and a MagSafe power port. You&#39;re also getting a 1080p FaceTime webcam and a Liquid Retina XDR display with a 3,024 x 1,964 resolution, up to 1,600 nits of brightness and a 120Hz refresh rate. The biggest downsides to the MacBook Pro are its non-upgradeable memory and storage, plus its high price tag. This discount addresses one of those issues, and overall, it&#39;s a solid laptop that will be best for power users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p> ]]>

            </title>
            <description type="html">
                <![CDATA[ <p>Amazon is facing legal consequences for its history of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-amazon-sack-employee-coronavirus-protest-fired.html">firing protest participants</a>. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/business/amazon-protest-firing-ruling.html">reports</a> that judge Benjamin Green has <a href="https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4583739076">ordered</a> Amazon to reinstate warehouse worker Gerald Bryson, who was fired from his role at Staten Island&#39;s JFK8 facility (the one that just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-jfk8-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-161459629.html">voted to unionize</a>) after allegedly violating language policies during a COVID-19 safety protest on April 6th, 2020. Green sided with a National Labor Relations Board argument that Amazon retaliated against Bryson for protesting, and reportedly used a &quot;skewed&quot; investigation to find pretexts for firing the employee.</p><p>Bryson (pictured above) had been protesting outside JFK8 and called for Amazon to shut down the warehouse for safety reasons. He got into a row with a female employee who said she was grateful for the work. Only Bryson was fired despite the two trading insults — the woman received a written warning. The people Amazon interviewed for its investigation provided &quot;one-sided, exaggerated&quot; versions of events, according to Green, including claims of racial slur use that weren&#39;t supported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bella.nagengast/videos/1079803845739201/">video evidence</a>. Amazon didn&#39;t interview the person who recorded the video.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The judge also found that Amazon had previously issued lighter punishments for more serious infractions (such as the use of violence). The company also didn&#39;t provide all the documents requested in a subpoena.</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Times</em>, Amazon said it &quot;strongly disagree[s]&quot; with Green&#39;s decision and claimed the NLRB wanted the company to &quot;condone&quot; Bryson&#39;s behavior. The tech giant planned to appeal the decision with the NLRB.</p><p>Amazon has been repeatedly accused of retaliating against staff who challenge its policies. Safety protest leader Chris Smalls accused the company of firing him for highlighting poor safeguards against COVID-19. Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, meanwhile, were supposedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fires-two-more-critics-173050857.html">fired for being vocal critics</a> of Amazon&#39;s climate and labor practices. Amazon said these workers were dropped for violating policy, but opponents rejected those assertions.</p><p>Bryson&#39;s win comes as Amazon faces a growing backlash from workers. On top of the successful unionization vote at JFK8, the company is grappling with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-second-vote-205945644.html">close rerun election</a> for unionization at an Alabama warehouse as well as a looming vote at a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-in-staten-island-becomes-second-to-set-union-election-date-002755399.html">second Staten Island facility</a>. Employees are increasingly demanding better treatment, and the company&#39;s attempts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-anti-union-report-election-staten-island-153310661.html">quash dissent</a> aren&#39;t always proving successful.</p> ]]>

Given that teams can have up to 64 players, voice chat could get messy fast with that many people talking over each other. A proximity-based option might have been helpful for callouts, though.
